# My Cybersecurity Portfolio
**Name:** WANG AIQI
**Role:** Master of Cyber Security Student at University of Malaya

## 1. About Me
Hello! I am a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast currently pursuing my Master's degree. My focus is on network security, ethical hacking, or digital forensics. I am dedicated to understanding the evolving threat landscape and developing skills to protect digital assets.

## 2. Technical Skills
My skillset focuses on secure network architecture, infrastructure hardening, and automation:
* **Network Simulation & Design:** GNS3, Cisco Packet Tracer (Topology Design, Inter-VLAN Routing).
* **Network Protocols:** TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, Subnetting, OSPF, STP，EIGRP.
* **Security Configurations:** **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**, **Port Security**, **NAT/PAT**, **SSH Hardening**.
* **Traffic Analysis:** Wireshark, **Tcpdump** (CLI packet analysis), **Netstat**.
* **Programming & Automation:** Python (**Socket**, **Requests** libraries), Bash Scripting.
* **Operating Systems & Virtualization:** Linux (Kali/Ubuntu), Windows Server, VMware, VirtualBox.

## 3. Certifications and Training
*(Note: As a specialized Master's student, my advanced coursework serves as my primary professional training.)*

**Master of Cyber Security** | University of Malaya (In Progress)
*Key Specialized Modules:*
* **Advanced Computer Penetration and Defence** – Focused on ethical hacking techniques, exploit development, and defensive countermeasures.
* **Advanced Network Security Programming** – Developing custom security tools and automating defenses using Python.
* **Network Technology and Security** – Deep dive into secure network architecture and protocols.
* **Cyber Security** – Comprehensive overview of information security governance and principles.
  
## 4. Project Experience
### Project 1: The Autonomous Threat Hunter (AI-Driven Security Agent)
**Context:** *WQE7002 - Advanced Network Security Programming*
**Objective:** Developed a "Purple Team" self-learning security agent for IoT networks that moves beyond static firewall rules.

* **Scenario:** Tasked with securing a remote IoT environment by building an agent that learns normal behavior and detects anomalies.
* **Technical Implementation:**
    * **Environment Mapping:** Used Python scripts to map the network topology.
    * **Traffic Generation:** Wrote scripts to simulate benign IoT traffic vs. malicious attack vectors to create a training dataset.
    * **Machine Learning:** Implemented a classification model (using Scikit-learn) to analyze **packet size** and **inter-arrival timing**, detecting attacks that bypass traditional port filtering.
    * **Real-Time Visualization:** Created a dashboard to visualize threat levels and classify traffic streams in real-time.
* **Outcome:** Successfully demonstrated how behavioral analysis can detect "low and slow" attacks that static firewalls miss.

### Project 2: Enterprise Secure Network Infrastructure Design
**Context:** *Undergraduate Thesis*
**Objective:** Designed a resilient network architecture for a Medium-to-Large Enterprise (SME) focusing on "Defense in Depth."

* **Methodology:**
    * Analyzed business requirements to segment critical assets from public-facing services.
    * Applied principles of Network Technology and Security to design a segmented topology.
* **Key Security Controls:**
    * **DMZ Implementation:** Isolated web and email servers to prevent lateral movement.
    * **VLAN Segmentation:** Logically separated HR, Finance, and IT traffic.
    * **Access Control:** Configured granular ACLs and firewall policies to enforce the principle of least privilege.
* **Outcome:** Delivered a blueprint that passed simulated vulnerability assessments for common LAN attacks (ARP Spoofing, MITM).
  
## 5. Learning Journey
**Reflections on the Master's Program:**
Transitioning from undergraduate studies to the Master of Cyber Security at UM has shifted my perspective from "configuring tools" to "building tools."
* **What I've Learned:**  I realized that modern security requires coding skills. Relying on pre-made tools is not enough; being able to script custom listeners or parsers in Python is a superpower. 
* **Current Challenges:** Mastering the complexities of **Advanced Computer Penetration** is challenging. Writing custom exploits requires a deep understanding of memory management and assembly, which I am currently strengthening.
* **Future Goals:** I am looking to undertake more cybersecurity projects to enhance my skills and boost my future career prospects.

## 6. Career Objective
**Aspiring Security Engineer & Automated Defense Specialist**

My professional goal is to secure modern digital infrastructures by bridging the gap between **Network Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I aim to work in a dynamic **Security Operations Center (SOC)** or as a **Security Engineer**, where I can apply my skills in Python automation, behavioral analysis, and threat hunting to build proactive defense systems.

Ultimately, I strive to contribute to the field of **Purple Teaming**, developing self-learning security agents that can adapt to sophisticated cyber threats faster than traditional manual interventions.
